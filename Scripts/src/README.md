# Source Code

Here follows a brief description of how the source code is organised and what are the different steps of the processing.

## Step 1: Image and Segmentation Preprocessing

The pipeline requires paired CT image and segmentation both saved in native resolution in separate (`.nrrd`) files. For DICOM to NRRD conversion steps, the (`dcm_to_nrrd`) script in (`/utils`) may be used.

1) Image and segmentation preprocessing 

Data preprocessing (`preprocessingroi_nrrd.py`); includes interpolation to 1x1x3 mm spacing, 10 mm circumferential ROI dilation, cropping and centering the lymph node region of interest

Note: The current script assumes that image and mask .nrrd files are saved with the following names:
	Image: \[DATASET]\_\[PATIENT ID]\_CT_raw_raw_raw_xx.nrrd
	Mask: mask3d_\[PATIENT ID]\_\[LYMPH NODE ID]\ (lymph node ID should start with '1' for a single node, and can increase sequentially if multiple lymph node segmentations are provided for a single scan)
	PATIENT ID must be consistent between the Image and Mask filenames

2) Test for ENE and Nodal Metastasis with DualNet

1. Test script (`test_ene.py`)
* Specifies default model and hyperparameters. 
* Loads data (`data_ene_test.py`); includes intensity normalization; generation of "box input" (118x118x32) and "zoomed in", size invariant input (32x32x32)
* Runs model inference and saves results to csv

* Model with weights used in manuscript can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BL1s-0NtIbT0BTMBldUbDu_et5QesIzJ/view?usp=share_link (DualNetENE-20220208-1531.h5). Model was trained with Tensorflow v2.4.
* Example image and segmentation mask can be found within the "examples" folder in the above link
